## MySensors

The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol.
The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.
